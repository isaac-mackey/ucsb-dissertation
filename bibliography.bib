@article{Nelson:TOPLAS89,
	abstract = {Dijsktra's calculus of guarded commands can be generalized and simplified
	by dropping the law of the excluded miracle. This paper gives a self-contained
	account of the generalized calculus from first principles through
	the semantics of recursion. The treatment of recursion uses the fixpoint
	method from denotational semantics. The paper relies only on the
	algebraic properties of predicates; individual states are not mentioned
	(except for motivation). To achieve this, we apply the correspondence
	between programs and predicates that underlies predicative programming.
	The paper is written from the axiomatic semantic point of view, but
	its contents can be described from the denotational semantic point
	of view roughly as follows: The Plotkin-Apt correspondence between
	wp semantics and the Smyth powerdomain is extended to a correspondence
	between the full wp/wlp semantics and the Plotkin powerdomain extended
	with the empty set.},
